        There are key differences between mortar cement and concrete even though they often get confused with one another, so ill begin by clearing this all up for you. Lets begin with mortar, which is what you see used in order to glue bricks together or fill gaps in between them. 
        now while there are different binders used to make mortar, im focusing on cement mortar, mostly because that is what is used and most other binders are simply ingredients of cement.
        mortar which uses cement as a binder is a third cement, (concrete being up to 15% cement) which makes a lot of sense in the context in which it is used.The rest of it is made up of sand, youll notice both materials have very similar composition, all based on cement. just like concrete, mortar is a dry ratio of cement and sand just like concrete, the key difference being the ratio of cement to gravel sand or stone. based on these ratios you have different properties to your mortar depending on its intended usage and can vary.
        Before the invention of modern portland cement mortar could be made with lime mud and clay, lime being the superior type of mortar of these three. Before the roman times mortar and cement were not hydraulic, making its use very limited. 
        Cement is a binder andan important ingredient of concrete which you might know for its spot as the most used man made material in the world and probably one of the most important considering the sheer amount of concrete and cement we produce and use. in fact, cement production causes 7% of the worlds co2 emissions! while thats a lot its certainly worth it despite not even being used on its own!
<br>
        there are two types of cement, hydraulic and nopn hydraulic, cement that can either withstand moisture or not respectively.cement has obviously been used for thousands of years however the first hydraulic cement was invented by the romans. before this, egyptians greeks and early romans used non hydraulic cement made of limestone (obviously). non hydraulic cement was made like this- 
        CaCo3 [limestone] -> Cao [quicklime] + Co2 [carbon dioxide]  
        <br>
        Cao [quicklime] + H2o [water] -> Ca(OH)2 [Calcium Hydroxide]
        <br>
        Cao(Oh)2 [calcium hydroxide] + Co2 = CaCo3 + H2o (g)
        <br>
        you might recognize what were left with as what we started with, limestone, esentially allowing us to cast limestone at will. This is all good until the obvious issue arises, all we did was add water! this means that when it rains or moisture is high the process can repeat itself against our will. this is why hydraulic cement is so important. the first hydraulic cement was invented by the romans and called roman concrete. the romans discovered that adding volcanic ash to their cement makes it hydraulic and successfully created calcium silicate hydrate, which is what we use nowadays only without the volcanic ash.
 <br>       
        nowadays we use a type of cement called portland cement. portland cement was patented by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 as "liquid rock" however, a working formula was only invented by his son William Aspdin. 60% of the energy used to make cement goes towards calcining* limestone into lime and Co2 (CaCo3 [limestone] + 2300 F -> CaO [quick lime] + Co2)
        <br>
        Clinker: material made in a rotating kiln composed of- [limestone] + [clay/slag*/fly ash/shale/sand/iron]
 <br><br>       
        *1- calcining is a process of heating up chemical elements to very high temperatures
        <br>
        *2- slag is a waste material composit of iron and SiO2
